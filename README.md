## Dataset

> The dataset initially contained 183,412 rows and 16 columns of record about individual bike rides  made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.The dataset can be found from the page from this link 'https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv'.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, i found out that the log transform distribution plot of the duration_min had a negative distribution. The distribution of the age and the distance each had a unimodal distribution. There were over 140,000 subscribers and less than 20,00o0 customers. There were almost 120,000 males, over 40,000 females and less than 10,000 other genders. There were more than 140,000 people who did not use bikeshare for all their trips and less than 20,000 who did. Thursdays had the most bikeshare use with almost 30,000 while sundays and saturdays had the least bikeshare use with their count being greater than 13,000. The corellation between all the numeric variables of the dataset was very small. CUstomers, other genders and people who did not use bike share for all their trips went the furthest distance on the bikes. ALl the user typeas had the same age average. Other gender and people who did not use bike share for all their trips were the oldest. Tuser type and bike share for all trip features. Thursdays had the most subscribers, customers, males, females, people who used bike share for all their trips and people who did not. the bike share for all trips feature had other gender spending the most time both for yes and no. There were no customers who used bike share for all their trips and subscribers spent the same amount of time on bikes whether its for all trips or not. Satuyrdays was when people spent the most time on bike when they are using it for all their trips. When they are not, they spend the most time on sa

>For the presentation, i focused on the amount of time spent on bike share for all trips and part of the trips. I began by introducing the duration, distance and bike share for all trips variable. Next i used an adpated bar plot to visualize the mean duration spent by the three main categorical features against the bikeshare for all trips feature. I usec a qualitative color scale so that each color represents a single entity in the plot.
